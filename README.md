# Instagram-Photo-Scraper

Scrape Instagram photos of a given user

## Features
- Takes a Instagram user name and downloads X photos starting from most recent ones
- You can define how many photos to be downloaded

## How to use
- You need a instagram user name and password. We propose to create a new account for this purpose to avoid any restrictions on your main account.
- Once you have your instagram user name and password, set them up in the "insta-scraper.properties" and save the property file.
- Run the insta-scraper.exe either by double clicking or by opening CMD prompt

## Development & Packaging
- TBA

## Next Steps
- Support for downloads by Tags
- Support for downloads without login (Unauthroized calls has a limitation on number of calls). We need to include a solution which supports proxies, commercial or otherwise
